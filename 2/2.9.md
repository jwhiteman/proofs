Conjecture: given two integers m and n, if at least
one of them is even then the product mn is even.

Case 1: one is even

Let m be even, written as 2k for some integer k
Let n be odd, written as 2j + 1 for some integer j

mn = 2k(2j + 1) = 2(k)(2j + 1)

Let l = (k)(2j + 1)
mn = 2l
which is the definition of an even number.

Case 2: both are even

Let m & n both be even so that
m = 2k
n = 2j
for some integers j & k.

mn = 2k(2j) = 2(2kj)

By fact 2.1, similar to above, this is the definition of even.
