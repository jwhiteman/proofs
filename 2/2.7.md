# proposition 2.4
"The sum of two integers is even"

# proposition 2.7
"If n is an integer, then n^2 + n + 6 is even"

Let n be even so that it can be written as 2k for some integer k

n^2 + n = 4k^2 + 2k = 2(2k^s + k)

By fact 2.1 this is even.

Adding 6 to this even number, by propisition 2.4, is also even.
