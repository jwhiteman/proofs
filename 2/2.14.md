"If m, n, & t are integers, then at least one of m - n, n - t and m - t is even"

Examples:
if m = 2 n = 3 t = 4, then m - t is even (-2)
if m = 1, n = 1, t = 1, then m - n, n - t and m - t are even
if m = 3, n = 5, t = 7, then m - n, n - t and m - t are even

Because there are only two options (even and odd) and there are 3 integers there will
either be at least 2 even or 2 odd numbers.

Case 1: at least 2 are even.

Assume m & n are even so that m = 2i and n = 2j.

m - n = 2i - 2j = 2(i - j), which is even.

This satisfies that requirement that at least one of m - n, n - t and m - t is even.

Case 2: at least 2 are odd:

Assume that m & n are odd so that m = 2i + 1 and n = 2j + 1.

m - n = 2i + 1 - (2j + 1) = 2i - 2j = 2(i - j), which is even.

This satisfies that requirement that at least one of m - n, n - t and m - t is even.
