# a

"If m & n are odd, then 5m - 3n is even"

Let m & n be odd, so that m = 2k + 1 and n = 2j + 1, for some integers k & j.

5m - 3n
= 5(2k + 1) - 3(2j + 1)
= 10k + 5 - 6j - 3
= 10k - 6j + 2
= 2(5k - 3j + 1)
= 2j

where j = 5k - 3j + 1

2j is the definition of an even number.

# b

"If m and n are even, then 3mn is divisible by 4"

Let m and n be even, so that m = 2k and n = 2j for some integers k & j.

3mn
= 3(2k)(2j)
= 12kj
= 4(3)(k)(j)
= 4l

where l = 3kj

If 3mn = 4l then 4 divides 3mn.
