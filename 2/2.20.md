"Determine the remainder when 3^302 is divided by 28"

Taking a look at the first few examples, starting at 1:

3^1 % 28 = 3
3^2 % 28 = 9
3^3 % 28 = 27
3^4 % 28 = 25
3^5 % 28 = 19
3^6 % 28 = 1
3^7 % 28 = 3
etc

This appears to be a repeating 6-value cycle: [3, 9, 27, 25, 19, 1]

If that pattern continues, then the remainder will the value above 1-indexed at 302 % 6.

302 % 6 = 2

So taking the second value from the cycle gives 9.
