# definitions
For some real number x, |x| = x if x >= 0 and |x| = -x if x < 0

# proof
"If x & y are real numbers, then |xy| = |x| * |y|"

examples:

|3(-2)|  = |3| * |-2|  = 6
|-3(-4)| = |-3| * |-4| = 12
|2(4)|   = |2| * |4|   = 8

Case 1: both x & y are positive. 

Then xy is positive, and therefore |xy| is positive.

Both x & y are positive in isolation (by assumption), so |x| and |y| both will stay positive.

The product |x| * |y| will stay positive.

Therefore |xy| = |x| * |y|

Case 2: both x & y are negative.

If x and y are both negative, then the product xy is positive, and therefore |xy| = xy.

Because x and y are both negative, then |x| = -x and |y| = -y, which are now both positive.

The product of two positive numbers -x * -y will be positive and equal to xy.

Therefore |xy| = |x| * |y| in this case.

Case 3: one of x & y is negative.

Let x be negative and y be positive.

The product xy will be negative, and |xy| = -xy which is positive.

|x| = -x and |y| = y, which are both positive, and their product equals -xy which is also positive.

Therefore |xy| = |x| * |y| for this final case.
