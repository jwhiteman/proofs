For each assume that m, n & t are integers:

# a

"1 | n"

n = 1n for any integer n.

n = 1(n)

Therefore 1 | n

# b

"n | n"

similar to a: n = 1n = n(1)

Therefore n | n

# c

"if mn | t, then m | t"

Assume mn | t

Then t = mnk = m(nk), for some integer k

Therefore m | t

# d

"if mn | tn, then m | t"

Assume that mn | tn

Then tn = mnk

Because mn divides tn, mn cannot be zero, and therefore neither m nor n can be zero.

So n can be divided out: t = mk = m(k)

Therefore m | t
