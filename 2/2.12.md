# facts

1: "If a < b and c is positive, then ac < bc"

# proof

"If m & n are positive real numbers and m < n, then m^2 < n^2"

Since m < n, m - n < 0

Because both m & n are positive their sum will be positive. Using fact 1 above, both
sides of the inequality can be multiplied by (m + n):

(m - n)(m + n) < 0

After expansion:

m^2 + nm - nm - n^2 < 0

Simplifying

m^2 - n^2 < 0

Adding n^2 to both sides:

m^2 < n^2

Which is what was set out to be proved.
