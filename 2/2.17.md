"For each of the following pairs of numbers, list all of their common divisors (positive & negative),
 and find gcd(a, b)"

# a

"a = 12, b = 330"

common divisors: 1, 2, 3, 6

gcd(12, 330) = 6

# b

"a = -36, b = 64"

divisors of a:
-1, 1, -2, 2, 3, -3, 4, -4, 6, -6, 9, -9, 12, -12, 18, -18, 36, -36

divisors of b:
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64

common divisors:
1, 2, 4

gcd(-36, 64) = 4

# c

"a = 7, b = -27"

divisors of 7:
1, 7

divisors of -27:
-27, -9, -3, -1, 1, 3, 9, 27

common divisors:
1

gcd(7, -27) = 1
