"If n is a positive integer, then 4 divides 1 + (-1)^n * (2n - 1)"

Case 1: n is even

Assume that n is a positive even integer n = 2k for some integer k.

Because n is even, (-1)^n will equal 1

2n - 1 = 2(2k) - 1 = 4k - 1

Plugging these two back in: 1 + (-1)^n * (2n - 1) = 1 + 1(4k - 1) = 4k

Therefore 4 | 1 + (-1)^n * (2n - 1), in the case that n is even.

Case 2: n is odd

Assume that n is a positive odd integer n = 2k + 1 for some integer k.

Because n is odd (-1)^n will equal -1.

2n - 1 = 2(2k + 1) - 1 = 4k + 2 - 1 = 4k + 1

Plugging these two back in: 1 + (-1)^n * (2n - 1) = 1 - 1(4k + 1) = 1 - 4k - 1 = -4k = 4(-k)

Therefore 4 | 1 + (-1)^n * (2n - 1), in the case that n is odd.
