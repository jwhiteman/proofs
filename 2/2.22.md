# problem

Assume that a is an integer and p and q are distinct primes.
Prove that if p | a and q | a, then pq | a.

# examples

## 1
```
p = 2
q = 3
a = 12

2 | 12, 3 | 2, 2(3) | 12
```


## 2
```
p = 3
q = 5
a = 30

3 | 30, 5 | 30, 15 | 30
```

## 3
```
p = 2
q = 7
a = 14

2 | 14, 7 | 14, 14 | 14
```

# proof

Because `p | a` and `q | a` then

`a = pk` and `a = qj` for some integers k & j.

p and q are both prime so the `gcd(p, q) = 1`

By Bezout's identity, there exist integers l & m so that `1 = pl + qm`

Multiplying both sides by a:

```
a = apl + aqm
```

We can substitute `pk` and `qj` for a:

```
a = qjpl + pkqm
a = pq(jl + km)
```

Because `jl + km` is just some integer `i`, then a = pqi, which is to say that `pq | a`
