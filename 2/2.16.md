"For each pair of integers, find the unique quotient and remainder when a is divided by m"

```
a = mq + r, where 0 <= r < m
```

# a

"a = 15, m = 4"

```
15 = 4q + r
15 = 4(3) + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15.
```

q is 3
r is 3, which is greater or equal to 0 and less than m (4)

# b

"a = 4, m = 15"

```
4 = 15q + r
4 = 15(0) + 4 = 4
```

q = 0
r = 4, which is greater or equal to 0 and less than m (15)

# c

"a = -7, m = 3"

```
-7 = 3q + r
-7 = 3(-3) + 2 = -7
```

q = -3
r = 2, which is greater or equal to 0 and less than m (3)

# d

"a = 65, m = 11"

```
65 = 11(q) + r
65 = 11(5) + 10 = 65
```

q = 5
r = 10, which is greater or equal to 0 and less than m (11)

# e

"a = -1, m = 15"

```
-1 = 15(q) + r
-1 = 15(-1) + 14 = -1
```

q = -1
r = 14, which is greater or equal to 0 and less than m (15)

# f

"a = 0, m = 4"

```
0 = 4(q) + r
0 = 4(0) + 0
```

q = 0
r = 0, which is greater or equal to 0 and less than m (4)
